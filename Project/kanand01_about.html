                    <p>My name's Kaavya Anand. I am a current junior in the iSchool at Syracuse University studying Information Management and Technology. 
                    I was born on February 19th 1999 in Bryn Mawr, PA. I am from Malvern, PA and have lived there for majority of my life.

                    <br>
                    I have two loving parents, a brother, and a sweet puppy named Leila. I am currently very involved in my school work and do 
                    not have much free time to do other things. I am a part of BeIT, Alpha Phi, JPC, and recently just volunteered for a company called OurWayv.</p>

                    <p>Right now I am looking for an internship for the upcoming summer and hope to find one very soon! This past summer, I worked as an IT intern
                    at Paratek Pharmaceuticals in King of Prussia, PA.

                    I am not quite sure what I want to do in my future or what I want to concetrate in in the iSchoool,
                    but I know that no matter what I choose I can't go wrong.</p>

                    <p>I am currently studying Information Management and Technology  which is a lot of fun and I absolutely love my major. I find that I do not have much difficulty in 
                    any of my classes and that I do a good job of really learning the material. My favorite class I've taken throughout college has been IST 344 with
                    Professor Young. From that class, I've learnt a lot about presenting and reporting and now feel that I'm able to give presentations in all my class
                    without feeling nervous and feeling confident about what I'm going to present.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>One class I have had the most difficulty in was IST 346, Information Technology Management and Administration. Throughout the class I had a very hard time really understanding what was going on, but thankfully had many different 
                    friends who were always there to help me. I enjoy my coursework throughout college and am excited to see what other classes I'll be taking in the future!</p>

                            <br>
                        <p> One of my favorite hobbies growing up was musical instruments. From the age of 5 I took violin lessons and self taught myself the piano. 
                            I also played the drums and the oboe for some time too! I played in my schools orchestra and band until I was 14. By the time I was in High School
                            my interest in music had started to drift.</p>

                            <br>
                        <p>When I was in middle school I started playing tennis. By the time I was 14 I was playing for my High School team and developed a serious interest in it.
                            I started playing tennis nearly everyday for hours and competing in tournaments on the weekend. I played varsity doubles my sophomore and junior year and 
                            varsity singles my senior year. I still love playing tennis to this day and know I will continue to love to play for the rest of my life! </p>
