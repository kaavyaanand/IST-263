            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>My name's Kaavya Anand. I am a current junior in the iSchool at Syracuse University studying Information Management and Technology. 
                    I was born on February 19th 1999 in Bryn Mawr, PA. I am from Malvern, PA and have lived there for majority of my life.
                    I have two loving parents, a brother, and a sweet puppy named Leila. I am currently very involved in my school work and do 
                    not have much free time to do other things. I am a part of BeIT, Alpha Phi, JPC, and recently just volunteered for a company called OurWayv.
                    Right now I am looking for an internship for the upcoming summer and hope to find one very soon! This past summer, I worked as an IT intern
                    at Paratek Pharmaceuticals in King of Prussia, PA. I am not quite sure what I want to do in my future or what I want to concetrate in in the iSchoool,
                    but I know that no matter what I choose I can't go wrong.

            <h2>School</h2>
            <p>Throughout elementary school, my favorite course had always been math. I always had a lot of difficulty in science, and to this day still do. 
                    When I was in the seventh grade, my parents wanted me to skip math two grade levels above. I started to have a lot of troubles in math class 
                    and was not doing well. I continued to follow that pattern throughout high school having a very hard time taking math, but when I got into college
                    I took calculus with a very good teacher and had found math being one of my favorite subjects again. Throughout high school I took many different classes, 
                    but always found that spanish was my favorite. To this day I can still read, write, and speak in Spanish and wish I continued to take it. I am now
                    studying Information Management and Technology which is a lot of fun and I absolutely love my major. I find that I do not have much difficulty in 
                    any of my classes and that I do a good job of really learning the material. My favorite class I've taken throughout college has been IST 344 with
                    Professor Young. From that class, I've learnt a lot about presenting and reporting and now feel that I'm able to give presentations in all my class
                    without feeling nervous and feeling confident about what I'm going to present. One class I have had the most difficulty in was IST 346, Information 
                    Technology Management and Administration. Throughout the class I had a very hard time really understanding what was going on, but thankfully had many different 
                    friends who were always there to help me. I enjoy my coursework throughout college and am excited to see what other classes I'll be taking in the future!

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Growing up, I have always been entertained by many different hobbies. The first thing I can remember getting involved with was playing the violin.
                    When I was 5 years old, my parents had put me through violin lessons. Around the same time I became very eager to learn how to play the piano. 
                    I wanted to learn how to play so bad, that I taught myself how to play through watching many different videos and printing out songs. Throughout
                    elementary school I learnt how to play many different instruments ranging from the drums to the oboe. I had a lot of fun and always felt musically inclined,
                    but around the time I had gotten into middle school my passion for music started to drift. Around the age of 12 I had started to get very interested
                    in playing tennis. Throughout high school, majority of my time was spent playing tennis everyday after school and playing in tournaments during the weekend.
                    On my highschool team I played varsity doubles my sophomore and junior year and varisty singles my senior year. I had a lot of fun playing tennis and 
                    had decided that I wanted to start coaching. Around the age of 16, I started teaching kids from the age of 5 to 12 how to play. It was always a really
                    great rewarding feeling knowing I was making a difference even in the slightest to their playing. To this day I still love to play tennis, but my biggest
                    regret is that I do not get to play as often as I'd like to.
