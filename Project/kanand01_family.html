    <h2>My Parents</h2>
    <p>My parents, Anand Sampath and Rama Swaminath, were both born in Chennai, India and grew up there for a significant amount of their lives.
        They grew up as next door neighbors, and still are to this day. My dad is currently a Network Analyst at Vanguard in Wayne, Pennsylvania. 
        He moved to the United States when he was young, and attended Johnson and Wales in Rhode Island. My mom currently works as a doctor at 
        Main Line Health, and finished her residency at Jefferson Hospital in Philadelpha, PA. She is soon switching jobs to work at Blue Cross in New 
        Jersey. Prior to moving to Malvern, Pennsylvania, my parents lived in Providence Rhode Island where they had my brother. They later moved to 
        King of Prussia, PA for some time before buying a house in Malvern. My parents both love to spend time outside with our dog, gardening, and 
        playing tennis. My mom loves to sing in her free time and sings in many different concerts. My dad loves to spend time with our dog. When we had
        our last dog Luna, he loved her so much and always took her for multiple walks a day and spoiled her. He now is doing the same with our new dog Leila. </p>

    <h2 id='headings'>My Brother</h2>
    <p>My brother, Shyam Anand, was born on April 29th 1993 in Providence, RI. He is six years older than me, so growing up we were never that close.
        My brother attended the same middle school and high school as me in the Great Valley School District. After he graduated High School, he attended
        NorthWestern University in Evanston, IL where he got his degree in Economics and German. Following college, he worked as a consultant at
        Capgemini for a year. During his junior year of college, he spent the entire year in Germany for study abroad; he fell so in love with the country that
        he moved there after working for a year. He currently lives in Germany and works as a DJ. Throughout college, my brother was making a lot of music, and found
        that Germany was the best spot for it. He now plays gigs around the world; he typically travels around Asia, Europe, and the United States. </p>

        <h3>Luna</h3>
        <p>My dog Luna, was a black lab mix born on March 10th 2010. We got her on May 22nd 2010 and it still remains to be one of the greatest days of my life.
            She was the sweetest dog in the entire world and used to always have a lot of fun playing and running around. She recently passed away this past April, 
            which has been very hard on my entire family. As a puppy, she used to spend a lot of time running around our house and she continued to throughout her life. 
            She was very smart and was able to understand English and the language my family speaks, Tamil. Over the summer, I used to take Luna hiking at Okehocking in Newtown Square, PA. 
            It was one of her favorite places to run around because dogs do not need to be on leashes there. She used to have a lot of fun running around in the creek there
            and exploring. Luna spent a lot of time running around the creek in our backyard as well and had a lot of fun in the water. Luna was the best dog to ever
            have as a first dog, and we miss her so much.

        <h3>Leila</h3>
        <p>My puppy Leila, is also a black lab mix born on February 12th 2019. We got her some time around May this year, and she is one of the goofiest puppies ever.
            I spent my entire summer playing and raising her and I wish I could have brought her to college with me. She is a lot of fun and loves to play every second
            of every day. When she was a little puppy she always would rip up all of her dog beds, so she no longer has the privilege of having one after ripping up four. 
            She is only around nine months old now, so she has some difficulty walking on a leash because she just wants to be free. She is unbelievably good at fetch, and 
            would run around for hours if she could. Right now she is terrified of the water and does not like to go swimming like Luna did. Over the summer, I taught her a lot of 
            different tricks. After one week with her, she was able to give a high five and loves to do tricks and is a quick learner. I am excited to see how she grows up
            and know she will be a really great dog.
