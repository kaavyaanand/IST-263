<h1>Project Idea</h1>
</main>
<body> 
<p>My idea is to create a website on my family. I plan on including a page for my parents, brother, and dog. I also plan on including pages for my town that I grew up in and a page about me. Iâ€™ll be able to pull all my content from my own gallery since the content is primarily about my life and the people in it.</p>
