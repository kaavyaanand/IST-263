<body>
<p>My name is Kaavya Anand, I am currently a junior majoring in information management
and technology in the iSchool. I was born in Malvern Pennsylvania and have lived there my
entire life. I have one older brother and one puppy named Leila. My family is very important to
me and I love spending time with them when I’m at home. I also enjoy exercising, playing
tennis, and getting outdoors. This past summer I had an internship working as an IT intern at
Paratek Pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>In the future I hope to find a stable job that I enjoy going to everyday that involves IT. I
find that the iSchool has prepared me very well for my future. When I’m at school I enjoy
hanging out with my friends and trying new things. I am involved in a few different clubs, but
also hope to find more things that peak my interest. One of my least favorite things about
Syracuse is the cold weather, but I am very excited to get out of it once I go abroad next
semester</p>
